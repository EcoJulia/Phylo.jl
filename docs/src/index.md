# Phylo

## A package for creating and manipulating phylogenies

**Phylo** is a [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) package that provides
functionality for generating phylogenetic trees. It plays well with the
[Diversity](https://github.com/ecojulia/Diversity.jl) package, i.e. to 
calculate phylogenetic diversity. Both are currently under development, so please
[raise an issue](https://github.com/ecojulia/Phylo.jl/issues) if you find any
 problems.

This package is currently less featured than the best phylogenetics packages in
R or Python. [Contributors](https://github.com/richardreeve/Phylo.jl/pulls) 
are very welcome!
