just like to ask a question.

## Summary

**Phylo** is a [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) package that provides
functionality for generating phylogenetic trees to feed into our
[Diversity][diversity-url] package to calculate phylogenetic
diversity. `Phylo` is currently in *beta*, but is probably still
missing much of the functionality that people may desire, so please
[raise an issue][issues-url] if/when you find problems or missing
functionality - don't assume that I know!

Currently the package can be used to make trees manually, to generate
random trees using the framework from `Distributions`, and to read
newick and nexus format trees from files. It can also be used to
evolve continuous and discrete traits on the resultant phylogenies,
and plot all of this using `Plots` recipes. Finally, the trees and
traits are capable of handling `Unitful` units, so the branch lengths
can be time based, and traits that relate directly to physical units
(e.g. size) can be directly evolved.

### Random tree generation

For instance, to construct a sampler for 5 tip non-ultrametric trees,
and then generate one or two random tree of that type (the examples
below are from the dev branch, but work similarly on the current
release):

```julia
julia> using Phylo

julia> nu = Nonultrametric(5);

julia> tree = rand(nu)
RootedTree with 5 tips, 9 nodes and 8 branches.
Leaf names are tip 2, tip 3, tip 1, tip 4 and tip 5

julia> trees = rand(nu, ["Tree 1", "Tree 2"])
TreeSet with 2 trees, each with 5 tips.
Tree names are Tree 2 and Tree 1

Tree 1: RootedTree with 5 tips, 9 nodes and 8 branches.
Leaf names are tip 5, tip 4, tip 2, tip 1 and tip 3

Tree 2: RootedTree with 5 tips, 9 nodes and 8 branches.
Leaf names are tip 3, tip 1, tip 2, tip 4 and tip 5
```

### Tree traversal

The code also provides iterators, and filtered iterators over the branches,
nodes, branchnames and nodenames of a tree, though this may soon be superseded
by a simpler strategy.

```julia
julia> traversal(tree, inorder)
9-element Vector{LinkNode{OneRoot, String, Dict{String, Any}, LinkBranch{OneRoot, String, Dict{String, Any}, Float64}}}:
 LinkNode tip 2, a tip of the tree with an incoming connection (branch 11).

 LinkNode Node 7, an internal node with 1 inbound and 2 outbound connections (branches 13 and 11, 12)

 LinkNode tip 3, a tip of the tree with an incoming connection (branch 12).

 LinkNode Node 8, an internal node with 1 inbound and 2 outbound connections (branches 15 and 13, 14)

 LinkNode tip 1, a tip of the tree with an incoming connection (branch 9).

 LinkNode Node 6, an internal node with 1 inbound and 2 outbound connections (branches 14 and 9, 10)

 LinkNode tip 4, a tip of the tree with an incoming connection (branch 10).

 LinkNode Node 9, a root node with 2 outbound connections (branches 15, 16)

 LinkNode tip 5, a tip of the tree with an incoming connection (branch 16).


julia> getnodename.(tree, traversal(tree, preorder))
9-element Vector{String}:
 "Node 9"
 "Node 8"
 "Node 7"
 "tip 2"
 "tip 3"
 "Node 6"
 "tip 1"
 "tip 4"
 "tip 5"

julia> collect(nodenamefilter(isleaf, tree))
5-element Vector{String}:
 "tip 1"
 "tip 2"
 "tip 3"
 "tip 4"
 "tip 5"
 ```

The current main purpose of this package is to provide a framework for
phylogenetics to use in our [Diversity][diversity-url] package, and
they will both be adapted as appropriate until both are functioning as
required (though they are currently working together reasonably successfully).

### Reading from a file

It can also read newick trees either from strings or files:

```julia
julia> using Phylo

julia> simpletree = parsenewick("((,Tip:1.0)Internal,)Root;")
RootedTree with 3 tips, 5 nodes and 4 branches.
Leaf names are Tip, Node 1 and Node 4


julia> getbranchname.(simpletree, getbranches(simpletree))
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4

julia> tree = open(parsenewick, Phylo.path("H1N1.newick"))
RootedTree with 507 tips, 1013 nodes and 1012 branches.
Leaf names are 227, 294, 295, 110, 390, ... [501 omitted] ... and 418
```

And it can read nexus trees from files too:

```julia
julia> tree = open(parsenewick, Phylo.path("H1N1.newick"))
RootedTree with 507 tips, 1013 nodes and 1012 branches.
Leaf names are 227, 294, 295, 110, 390, ... [501 omitted] ... and 418

julia> ts = open(parsenexus, Phylo.path("H1N1.trees"))
[ Info: Created a tree called "TREE1"
[ Info: Created a tree called "TREE2"
TreeSet with 2 trees, each with 507 tips.
Tree names are TREE2 and TREE1

TREE1: RootedTree with 507 tips, 1013 nodes and 1012 branches.
Leaf names are H1N1_A_BRAZIL_11_1978, H1N1_A_TAHITI_8_1998, H1N1_A_TAIWAN_1_1986, H1N1_A_BAYERN_7_1995, H1N1_A_ENGLAND_45_1998, ... [501 omitted] ... and H1N1_A_PUERTORICO_8_1934

TREE2: RootedTree with 507 tips, 1013 nodes and 1012 branches.
Leaf names are H1N1_A_BRAZIL_11_1978, H1N1_A_TAHITI_8_1998, H1N1_A_TAIWAN_1_1986, H1N1_A_BAYERN_7_1995, H1N1_A_ENGLAND_45_1998, ... [501 omitted] ... and H1N1_A_PUERTORICO_8_1934


julia> ts["TREE1"]
RootedTree with 507 tips, 1013 nodes and 1012 branches.
Leaf names are H1N1_A_BRAZIL_11_1978, H1N1_A_TAHITI_8_1998, H1N1_A_TAIWAN_1_1986, H1N1_A_BAYERN_7_1995, H1N1_A_ENGLAND_45_1998, ... [501 omitted] ... and H1N1_A_PUERTORICO_8_1934


julia> gettreeinfo(ts)
Dict{String, Dict{String, Any}} with 2 entries:
  "TREE2" => Dict("lnP"=>-1.0)
  "TREE1" => Dict("lnP"=>1.0)

julia> gettreeinfo(ts, "TREE1")
Dict{String, Any} with 1 entry:
  "lnP" => 1.0
```

### Calculating metrics

We so far only support calculating a few metrics on trees, but will gradually be added. Open an issue with a request!

```julia
julia> species = getleaves(tree)[[2, 5, 8, 12, 22]];  # take 5 tips from the phylogeny (or use names)

julia> mrca(tree, species)                 # Identify the MRCA (Most Recent Common Ancestor)
LinkNode Node 65, an internal node with 1 inbound and 2 outbound connections (branches 999 and 61, 62)
```

### R interface

And while we wait for me (or kind [contributors][pr-url]!) to fill out
the other extensive functionality that many phylogenetics packages
have in other languages, the other important feature that it offers is
a fully(?)-functional interface to R, allowing any existing R library
functions to be carried out on julia trees, and trees to be read from
disk and written using R helper functions. Naturally the medium-term
plan is to fill in as many of these gaps as possible in Julia, so the R interface does not make RCall a dependency of the package (we use the
`Requires` package to avoid dependencies). Instead, if you want to use
the R interface you just need to use both packages:

```julia
julia> using Phylo

julia> using RCall
Creating Phylo RCall interface...

R> library(ape)
```

You can then translate back and forth using `rcopy` on
R `phylo` objects, and `RObject` constructors on julia `NamedTree`
types to keep them in Julia or `@rput` to move the object into R:

```julia
julia> rt = rcall(:rtree, 10)
RCall.RObject{RCall.VecSxp}

Phylogenetic tree with 10 tips and 9 internal nodes.

Tip labels:
  t10, t8, t1, t2, t6, t5, ...

Rooted; includes branch lengths.

julia> jt = rcopy(NamedTree, rt)
NamedTree with 10 tips, 19 nodes and 18 branches.
Leaf names are t8, t3, t7, t9, t6, ... [4 omitted] ... and t1

julia> rjt = RObject(jt); # manually translate it back to R

R> if (all.equal($rjt, $rt)) "no damage in translation"
[1] "no damage in translation"

julia> @rput rt; # Or use macros to pass R object back to R

julia> @rput jt; # And automatically translate jt back to R

R> jt

Phylogenetic tree with 10 tips and 9 internal nodes.

Tip labels:
  t10, t8, t1, t2, t6, t5, ...

Rooted; includes branch lengths.

R> if (all.equal(rt, jt)) "no damage in translation"
[1] "no damage in translation"
```

For the time being the code will only work with rooted trees
with named tips and branch lengths. If there's [demand][issues-url]
for other types of trees, I'll look into it.

### Trait evolution

As far as traits are concerned, these can be continuous pr
discrete. First a continuous trait:

```julia
julia> using Phylo, Plots, DataFrames, Random

julia> tree = rand(Nonultrametric(100)) # Defaults to mean tree depth of 1.0
RootedTree with 100 tips, 199 nodes and 198 branches.
Leaf names are tip 41, tip 7, tip 37, tip 81, tip 88, ... [94 omitted] ... and tip 89

julia> rand!(BrownianTrait(tree, "Trait"), tree)  # Defaults to starting at 0.0, variance 1.0
RootedTree with 100 tips, 199 nodes and 198 branches.
Leaf names are tip 41, tip 7, tip 37, tip 81, tip 88, ... [94 omitted] ... and tip 89

julia> plot(tree, line_z = "Trait", lw = 2)

julia> d = DataFrame(nodename=getnodename.(tree, traversal(tree, preorder)), trait=getnodedata.(tree, traversal(tree, preorder), "Trait"))
199×2 DataFrame
│ Row │ nodename │ trait      │
│     │ String   │ Float64    │
├─────┼──────────┼────────────┤
│ 1   │ Node 199 │ 0.0        │
│ 2   │ Node 198 │ 0.334372   │
│ 3   │ Node 163 │ 0.734348   │
│ 4   │ Node 138 │ 0.588014   │
│ 5   │ tip 41   │ 0.749697   │
⋮
│ 195 │ tip 64   │ -0.791095  │
│ 196 │ tip 75   │ -0.4173    │
│ 197 │ tip 82   │ -0.305623  │
│ 198 │ tip 71   │ -0.868774  │
│ 199 │ tip 89   │ -0.30126   │
```

Then a discrete trait:

```julia
julia> @enum TemperatureTrait lowTempPref midTempPref highTempPref

julia> rand!(SymmetricDiscreteTrait(tree, TemperatureTrait, 0.4), tree);

julia> plot(tree, marker_group = "TemperatureTrait", legend = :topleft,
            msc = :white, treetype = :fan, c = [:red :blue :green])

julia> d = DataFrame(nodename=getnodename.(tree, traversal(tree, preorder)), trait=getnodedata.(tree, traversal(tree, preorder), "TemperatureTrait"))
199×2 DataFrame
│ Row │ nodename │ trait                              │
│     │ String   │ TemperatureTrait                   │
├─────┼──────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1   │ Node 199 │ highTempPref::TemperatureTrait = 2 │
│ 2   │ Node 198 │ lowTempPref::TemperatureTrait = 0  │
│ 3   │ Node 163 │ lowTempPref::TemperatureTrait = 0  │
│ 4   │ Node 138 │ lowTempPref::TemperatureTrait = 0  │
│ 5   │ tip 41   │ lowTempPref::TemperatureTrait = 0  │
⋮
│ 195 │ tip 64   │ midTempPref::TemperatureTrait = 1  │
│ 196 │ tip 75   │ highTempPref::TemperatureTrait = 2 │
│ 197 │ tip 82   │ highTempPref::TemperatureTrait = 2 │
│ 198 │ tip 71   │ highTempPref::TemperatureTrait = 2 │
│ 199 │ tip 89   │ highTempPref::TemperatureTrait = 2 │
```
